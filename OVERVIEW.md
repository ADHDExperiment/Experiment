Problem

There are ADHD adults who are barely managing their condition 
and failing to thrive in the workplace, in personal relationships 
and in society. People with ADHD have difficulty reaching short 
and long term goals or completing tasks because of poor time 
management skills and difficulty prioritizing.

- Many of these individuals cannot sustain employment for as long as a year.
- Their day-to-day environments and routines are unmanaged. 
- Personal hygiene may be ignored.
- Eating meals on a regular basis can be a challenge.
- Mismanaged finances complicates their lives.

It’s easy to assume that these productive habits were developed in childhood and adolescence. However, the complications of family structure, discipline practices, knowledge about ADHD management/treatment, resistance to structure and mixed-message parenting may have never supported the development of life skills that most people need to thrive.

For many ADHD adults, pharmacological treatment is insufficient. Some individuals self-medicate with negative coping mechanisms such as drug abuse, pornography abuse, alcohol abuse, eating disorders, over-exercising, obsessive use of technology or anti-social behavior, none of which cannot be addressed with medication alone. There are ways to overcome these negative coping mechanisms; however, they are highly dependent on the patient, the environment and the specific habit being targeted. 

If these individuals had a sufficient support system and the financial resources to seek independently provided therapies, their ADHD would be adequately managed.

Since their condition is effectively unmanaged, they may lack emotional and practical support, life skills, as well as the financial resources that therapeutic treatment requires. These individuals may qualify for social programs provided by the US government (SSDI, SSI, Medicaid, Medicare), but the mere design of the application processes involve copious paperwork and a process that can stretch across many months or even years before coverage and access to care is granted. 

The majority of studies examining the efficacy of different therapies for ADHD adults report success for their specific, respective targeted issues in the 70%-90% range.

Overcoming coping mechanisms that have been trained over the course of several years typically requires a sufficient support system._**--REWRITE**_

ADHD is strongly correlated with a malfunction in the brain’s reward system and operates on a neurological level in a manner that’s similar to addiction. Specifically, the brain is over rewarding undesired actions relative to desired ones.

Like drug rehab centers, which grew more rapidly once society and the healing professions began to acknowledge alcoholism and drug abuse as treatable diseases rather than personal failings, the recognition of ADHD as a treatable disease is gaining momentum. 

Habit loops that contain negative cycles

### Solutions Available

Individual Therapy

Life coaching

Intensive Outpatient therapy

Inpatient Therapy/Rehab program

Several types of therapy (most notably CBT, CPT, ACT, and DBT) have been beneficial for treating different issues in adults that stem ADHD. Life coaching, support groups, dietary changes, meditation, and exercise are also resulted in improved management of ADHD in adults. 

If unmanaging ADHD adults can afford an ACA-compliant health insurance plan, as well as their deductible, they can afford to seek independently provided treatment, as long as their support system (which includes positive coping mechanisms) can sufficiently plan and oversee treatment management.

Why this solution may be right

The reSTART Internet Addiction Recovery Program is an inpatient facility located near Seattle, WA in Fall City. It offers a program designed as a traditional addiction rehab centers that includes all the types of therapies/activities previously mentioned.

The makeup of reSTART’s program aligning with treatments for managing ADHD in adults is unsurprising, since the root of both problems involve the same core mechanisms in the brain malfunctioning in the same general way, though the actual neurological mechanisms may be found to be different in the future.
reSTART is the only program of its kind that I’ve found in the US.

We are modeling Rehabit after the reSTART program as an in-home treatment plan that can be easily modified for ADHD adults, can teach an adult with unmanaged ADHD how to manage their condition and will cost at most 25% of reSTART’s program for the same length of time. 

The minimum requirements for a proper treatment plan implied by Rehabit's model are: 
  - (a) health insurance
  - (b) an initial period of time (est. 3 months) that involves abstaining from recurring undesired habits and limited exposure to society that ends when the patient has progressed to a certain point TBD
  - (c) a secondary period of time (est. 6 months) that involves a reintroduction into society, as well as seeking employment if patient is unemployed
  - (d) an ADHD specialist who works with the patient, caregiver, and patient’s family to plan and oversee the patient’s program
  - (e) independent therapists who are local to the patient and covered by health insurance to provide relevant psychological treatments
  - (f) life coaching for budgeting, shopping, seeking/maintaining employment
  - (g) daily, weekly, and monthly schedules that include physical and meditative activities, as well as those required for a minimally healthy lifestyle (hygiene, diet, household chores, managing finances, etc.)
  - (h) a caregiver: someone living with the patient who the patient recognizes and accepts as an authority figure whose responsibility it is to monitor the patient throughout the day and keep them on-track with their schedule and program
  - (i) support groups for ADHD and any comorbid issues/addictions relevant to the patient

### Compelling case for home based Rehabit

The inventory of in-patient ADHD treatment programs is very limited and not likely covered by insurance; therefore, in-patient ADHD treatment programs are unaffordable for most ADHD suffers living in households earning less than $150,000/year. 

reSTART costs approximately $80k USD for 9 months of treatment and has a 95% success rate. reSTART has treated 50-100 people total and its failures are reported as the result of patients who didn’t want to enroll.

reSTART is not covered by most insurance plans. Its individual components are available through independent providers and those related to mental health are required by law to be covered by ACA-compliant insurance plans.

2.	There are ADHD adults who are barely managing their condition, if at all. If they had a sufficient support system and the financial resources to seek independently provided therapies, their ADHD would be adequately managed. Since their condition is effectively unmanaged, they lack both support and finances. They may qualify for social programs provided by the US government (SSDI, SSI, Medicaid, Medicare), but the programs aren’t designed with ADHD in mind and so have a lengthy application process involving tens of pages of paperwork that’s spread across months or years before being approved for coverage. The general implication here is that the market value of adults with unmanaged ADHD, from a business perspective, is effectively zero.

Comorbid Considerations
The original hypothesis needs to be amended in order to accommodate different comorbid conditions (conditions patients often have alongside ADHD, such as bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression, etc.). What follows are changes needed to account for those specific conditions.
Life that can't be severely interrupted
Bipolar Disorder

Addiction are cycles of habits, a habit network that has cycles in it. Some habits just need to be thoughts or emotions.
