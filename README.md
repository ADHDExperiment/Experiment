## Scientific-Method-Inspired Overview

#### Observations
1. Several types of therapy (most notably CBT, CPT, ACT, and DBT) have been beneficial for treating different issues in adults that stem ADHD. Life coaching, support groups, dietary changes, meditation, and exercise are also resulted in improved management of ADHD in adults. 
- Majority of studies examining the efficacy of different therapies for ADHD adults report success for their specific, respective targeted issues in the 70%-90% range.
- For many ADHD adults, Medication is not enough to manage their condition due to negative coping mechanisms developed in response to ADHD that cant be addressed with medication. There are numerous ways to overcome pre-existing coping mechanisms; they are highly dependent on the patient and specific habit being targeted.
- Overcoming coping mechanisms that have been trained over the course of several years typically requires a sufficient support system.
- ADHD is strongly correlated with a malfunction in the brains reward system and operates on a neurological level in a manner thats similar to addiction. Specifically, the brain is over rewarding undesired actions relative to desired ones.
- The reSTART Internet Addiction Recovery Program is an inpatient facility located near Seattle, WA in Fall City. It offers a program designed as a traditional addiction rehab centers that includes all the types of therapies/activities previously mentioned.
- reSTART is the only program of its kind that Ive found in the US.
- The makeup of reSTARTs program aligning with treatments for managing ADHD in adults is unsurprising, since the root of both problems involve the same core mechanisms in the brain malfunctioning in the same general way, though the actual neurological mechanisms may be found to be different in the future.
- reSTART costs approximately $80k USD for 9 months of treatment and has a 95% success rate. reSTART has treated 50-100 people total and its failures are reported as the result of patients who didnt want to enroll.
- reSTART is not covered by most insurance plans. Its individual components are available through independent providers and those related to mental health are required by law to be covered by ACA-compliant insurance plans.
- If unmanaging ADHD adults can afford an ACA-compliant health insurance plan, as well as their deductible, they can afford to seek independently provided treatment, as long as their support system (which includes positive coping mechanisms) can sufficiently plan and oversee treatment management.
- People with ADHD have difficulty tracking and accomplishing lengthy processes spread across months or years of time due to problems with time management, task prioritization, scheduling, and completing tedious tasks.

#### Hypothesis
1. There are ADHD adults who are barely managing their condition, if at all. If they had a sufficient support system and the financial resources to seek independently provided therapies, their ADHD would be adequately managed. Since their condition is effectively unmanaged, they lack both support and finances. They may qualify for social programs provided by the US government (SSDI, SSI, Medicaid, Medicare), but the programs arent designed with ADHD in mind and so have a lengthy application process involving tens of pages of paperwork thats spread across months or years before being approved for coverage. The general implication here is that the market value of adults with unmanaged ADHD, from a business perspective, is effectively zero.
2. An in-home treatment plan thats modeled after the reSTART program, but designed for ADHD adults, can teach an adult with unmanaged ADHD how to manage their condition and will cost at most 25% of reSTARTs program for the same length of time. 
    - The minimum requirements for a proper treatment plan are:
		- health insurance
		- an initial period of time (est. 3 months) that involves abstaining from recurring undesired habits and limited exposure to society that ends when the patient has progressed to a certain point TBD
		- a secondary period of time (est. 6 months) that involves a reintroduction into society, as well as seeking employment if patient is unemployed
		- an ADHD specialist who works with the patient, caregiver, and patients family to plan and oversee the patients program
		- independent therapists who are local to the patient and covered by health insurance to provide relevant psychological treatments
		- life coaching for budgeting, shopping, seeking/maintaining employment
		- daily, weekly, and monthly schedules that include physical and meditative activities, as well as those required for a minimally healthy lifestyle (hygiene, diet, household chores, managing finances, etc.)
		- a caregiver: someone living with the patient who the patient recognizes and accepts as an authority figure whose responsibility it is to monitor the patient throughout the day and keep them on-track with their schedule and program
		- support groups for ADHD and any comorbid issues/addictions relevant to the patient

#### Comorbid Considerations
The original hypothesis needs to be amended in order to accommodate different comorbid conditions (conditions patients often have alongside ADHD, such as bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression, etc.). What follows are changes needed to account for those specific conditions.

##### Life that can't be severely interrupted
##### Bipolar Disorder
